## Backlog
ğŸ•™ - End-to-end post size on mobile phones<br />
ğŸ•™ - Infinite scroll for Feed page<br />
ğŸ•™ - Eslint<br />
ğŸ•™ - Comment submit btn<br />
ğŸ•™ - Profile images<br />
ğŸ•™ - Post images<br />
ğŸ•™ - Adding friends and restricting non-friend access to profile<br />
ğŸ•™ - Exploding, well-defined design system, free from libraries<br />
ğŸ•™ - Largest contentful paint skeleton + loading indicators for every single thing<br />
ğŸ•™ - Protobuf!<br />
ğŸ•™ - Cache any posts younger than one month and only fetch newer ones during session<br /><br />

ğŸ•™ - Clicking on a username sends a /registry request before loading the appropriate profile page<br />
      - This is due to needint to load the page user and it being inside an effect<br />
      - Loading the posts is glitchy man. Sometimes clicking a user from a post author in the feed, loads the wrong stuff. But only sometimes. Makes you question reality. This needs a cleaner, simpler, tidier logic.
